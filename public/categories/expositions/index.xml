    The introduction of cohomology is a &lt;em&gt;technique&lt;/em&gt; for making the invisible visible.
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;yh-pullquote-attrib&#34;&gt;— Alexander Grothendieck&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we study the Brauer group of a field, which classifies central simple algebras (or Azumaya algebras) over the field. They eventually generalize to schemes and control rational points on a variety. I will mostly follow &lt;span class=&#34;yh-ref&#34; data-ref-kind=&#34;bib&#34;
      data-cite-key=&#34;Poo17&#34;&gt;
  ⟦cite:Poo17⟧
&lt;/span&gt; with possibly some other sources as supplements. My eventual goal is to understand Brauer-Manin obstructions to rational points, and how Brauer groups of schemes is related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin by fixing some notation and terminology common in algebraic number theory. We fix a field $K$ with algebraic closure $\overline{K}$, separable closure $K^{\mathrm{sep}}$, and perfect closure $K^{\mathrm{perf}}$. Denote the absolute Galois group as $\mathrm{G}_K=\mathrm{Gal}(K^{\mathrm{sep}}/K)$. If $K$ is a global field, Let $\Omega_K$ be the set of its places, $S_{\infty}\subset L$ the set of archimedean places. And $S\subseteq \Omega_K$ is said to be an &lt;em&gt;admissible&lt;/em&gt; set of places of $K$ if it contains $S_\infty$. For an admissible set of places $S$ of $K$, denote by $\mathbb Z_{K, S}$ the $S$-integers of $K$ with $\mathbb Z_K=\mathbb Z_{K,S_{\infty}}$ the usual ring of integers. For $S\subseteq \Omega_K$ a finite set of places, denote the ring of $S$-adeles $\mathbb A_{K,S}$ and the usual adeles $\mathbb A_K$. Denote $\mathbb I_{K,S}$ the $S$-ideles and $\mathbb I_K$ the usual ideles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;galois-theory-of-étale-algebras&#34;&gt;Galois Theory of Étale Algebras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with field extensions $L \mid K$ is that if one has an extension $M\mid K$ then the base change $L\otimes_K M$ is not a field but a $M$-algebra. To solve this issue, we introduce the notion of étale algebras in &lt;span class=&#34;yh-ref&#34; data-ref-kind=&#34;math&#34; data-ref-id=&#34;def-etale&#34;&gt;⟦ref:def-etale⟧&lt;/span&gt;, which comes from étale maps i.e. local homeomorphisms in topology, indeed the notion of étale morphism $\mathrm{Spec}(L)\rightarrow \mathrm{Spec}(K)$ is thought of as an analogy for that.

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;math-body&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A $K$-algebra $L$ is said to be &lt;em&gt;étale&lt;/em&gt; if any of the following equivalent conditions are satisfied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$L\otimes_K K^{\mathrm{sep}}\cong (K^{\mathrm{sep}})^n$ for some $n$,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$L$ is a direct product of finite separable extensions of $K$,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the induced map $\mathrm{Spec}(L)\rightarrow \mathrm{Spec}(K)$ is finite and étale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Étaleness is stable under base change. For $M\mid K$ a field extension and $L$ an étale $K$-algebra, we have $L\otimes_K M$ is an étale $M$-algebra. With étale algebras, the following is Grothendieck&#39;s generalization of Galois theory.&lt;/p&gt;

    There is an equivalence of categories between $\{\textrm{finite }\mathrm G_K\textrm{-sets}\}^{\mathrm{op}}$ and $\{\textrm{étale }K\textrm{-algebras}\}$ given by the functors that take $S$, a finite $\mathrm G_K$-set, to the étale $K$-algebra $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm G_K\textrm{-sets}}(S,K^{\mathrm{sep}})$, and conversely take an étale $K$-algebra $L$ to the finite $\mathrm G_K$-set $\mathrm{Hom}_{K\textrm{-Alg}}(L,K^{\mathrm{sep}})$.

    Suppose $S$ is a transitive $\mathrm G_K$-set, then $S=\mathrm G_K/H$ for some open subgroup $H$, so the corresponding étale algebra is $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm G_K\textrm{-sets}}(\mathrm G_K/H, {K}^{\mathrm{sep}})=(K^\mathrm{sep})^H$ the fixed field in classical Galois theory. In general, a finite $\mathrm G_K$-set is the finite disjoint union of transitive ones $\coprod S_i$, so $S$ corresponds to the étale algebra $\prod L_i$ where $L_i$ is the finite separable extension corresponding to $S_i$.

      <title>What is This Thing Called Knowledge?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/knowledge/</link>

      <description>&lt;aside class=&#34;yh-pullquote&#34; style=&#34;--yh-pullquote-w: 50%;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;yh-pullquote-text&#34;&gt;
    Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is -- insofar as it is thinkable at all -- primitive and muddled.
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;yh-pullquote-attrib&#34;&gt;— Albert Einstein &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, epistemology is a branch of philosophy which studies knowledge. It concerns problems such as: how is knowledge defined (what does it mean to know something)? What is the value of knowledge? What is the structure of knowledge? I became interested in epistemology recently and have started reading Duncan Pritchard&#39;s introductory text &lt;em&gt;What is This Thing Called Knowledge?&lt;/em&gt; I can&#39;t help but want to write down some of the things I&#39;ve learned from my reading. In this post, I will talk about some key ideas from  Pritchard&#39;s book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-of-criterion&#34;&gt;The Problem of Criterion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think about what we know, we usually think about one of two kinds of knowledge: 1. &lt;em&gt;propositional knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, knowledge expressible with a proposition, such as &amp;quot;the sky is blue&amp;quot;, or 2. &lt;em&gt;ability knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, such as the knowledge of how to swim. Henceforth, when talking about knowledge, we will always be referring to the former. It is agreed upon epistemologists that the two basic elements for one to posess a piece of knowledge are truth and belief: one should believe the knowledge and the knowledge itself should be true. However, these two conditions not sufficient. Knowledge is not merely true beliefs: one can have true beliefs completely by accident. Suppose that there is a doctor who diagnoses a patient by a toss of a coin. Suppose also that the coin toss happens to give the correct diagnoses, then does it follow that the doctor knows what is wrong with the patient? Obviously not. Thus, it is a problem for epistemologists to try and figure out what is needed to be added to give a satisfactory definition (i.e. criterion) of knowledge. However, anyone who wishes to define knowledge faces the an immediate problem. To know the criterion of knowledge we need to know all that we do know, but to know all that we do know requires us to know the criterion of knowledge itself. It&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;Catch-22&lt;/em&gt;. This is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_the_criterion&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;problem of the criterion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do we know (what is the extent of our knowledge)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we know (what is the criterion of knowledge)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these two problems are impossible to answer without first answering the other. One approach seeks to answer the first question first -- this is stance called &lt;em&gt;particularism&lt;/em&gt;, advocated by Roderick Chisholm &amp;quot;we start with particular cases of knowledge and then from those we generalise and formulate criteria [which tell] us what it is for a belief to be epistemologically respectable.&amp;quot; The antithesis of this position is &lt;em&gt;methodism&lt;/em&gt;, exemplified by René Descartes, which seeks to answer the second question first. This position states that it is possible, through philosophical reflection alone, to identify criterions of knowledge, and through which to identify instances of knowledge. This is the position taken by classical empiracists. There is also a third stance, skepticism, which proclaims that since it is impossible to answer one question without the other, we are unable to answer either question, and hence unable to justify any of our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gettier-cases&#34;&gt;Gettier Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very natural methodist attempt to the problem of criterion, typically attributed to Plato, is to proclaim that knowledge are &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; true beliefs, i.e. true beliefs with some good basis or grounds. This is the &lt;em&gt;tripartite theory of knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. However, things are not that simple. The philosopher Edmund Gettier, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/23/6/121/109949&#34;&gt;a three-page article&lt;/a&gt;, gave a list of devastating counter-examples to the tripartite theory, which we call the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gettier Cases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showing that it is completely untenable. In essence, it shows that you could have a justified true belief but still lack knowledge because your true belief was gained by luck in the same way as the previous example of the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will here paraphrase an example of such a case from Pritchard&#39;s book. Imagine a man named, say, John, comes downstairs one morning and sees the clock on the living room says it&#39;s 8 o&#39;clock. On this basis, John believes it is 8 o&#39;clock. John usually comes downstairs around this time, and the clock has been very realiable in the past, so John is justified in his belief. Suppose, however, it was unbeknownst to him that the clock had stopped precisely 12 hours ago. So John had a justified true belief which does not intuitively constitute knowledge -- other Gettier cases more or less have the same structure as this example. Therefore, the tripartite account is insufficient for the criterion of knowledge (it is, however, agreed among epistemologists that the tripartite conditions are necessary for having knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at first believed that the Gettier cases could be amended by tweaking the tripartite condition, such as stipulating that the belief should be true, justified, and not based on false presuppositions. However, it is difficult to specify the meaning of &amp;quot;presuppositions&amp;quot;, e.g. you could have a justification of a true belief with a false presupposition. For example, John could have a friend Sally who looks at a working clock and thinks that the time is 8 o&#39;clock, but she might justify this by presupposing the clock is regularly maintained, which happens to not be the case. Moreover, it is also not clear that a presuppoosition is needed at all. For example, suppose a farmer forms a belief that there is a sheep in the field by looking at a shaggy dog which looks like a sheep, but there actually is a sheep on the field, standing behind the dog. Thus, it is difficult to respond to Gettier cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;agrippas-trilemma&#34;&gt;Agrippa&#39;s trilemma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of justification is enigmatic. Pick any belief for which you have a justification, then it still remains the question: what justifies the justification itself? And if we have a justification of that justification, what justifies it then? We could keep asking this question ad infinitum. Thus, we find ourselves in the following predicament called the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma#Agrippa&#39;s_Trilemma&#34;&gt;Agrippa&#39;s trilemma&lt;/a&gt; (or Münchhausen trilemma): in order to justify any statement, we must accept one of the following kind of arguments, each of which is unsatisfactory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;circular argument&lt;/em&gt;: the justification of a proposition presupposes itself,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;regressive argument&lt;/em&gt;: each justification requires a further justification ad infinitum,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;dogmatic argument&lt;/em&gt;: some statements are regarded as accepted precepts (merely asserted but not defended).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some philosophers embrace option 1, and proclaim that a circular chain of arguments can justify a claim, which is a position called &lt;em&gt;coherentism&lt;/em&gt;. This is usually supplemented with the proviso that the circular chain must be large enough. Other philosophers embrace option 2, and proclaim that we can justify a claim by an infinite chain of arguments, which is a position called &lt;em&gt;infinitism&lt;/em&gt;. The third position is to embrace option 3, and proclaim some beliefs are justified without without any further justification, which is a position known as &lt;em&gt;foundationalism&lt;/em&gt; -- the position taken in modern mathematics. The dominant foundationalist view states that some beliefs do not require further justification because there are self-justifying -- this is known as &lt;em&gt;classical foundationalism&lt;/em&gt;. An example of a classical foundationalist is Descartes. He argued that the foundations for our knowledge are those that immune to doubt and are hence self-evident. He gave the example of ones belief of ones own existance. I cannot doubt my own existance because for me to doubt -- to think -- requires my existing in the first place. Hence his famous line, &amp;quot;I think, therefore I am.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-of-perception&#34;&gt;The Problem of Perception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large portion of our knowledge comes from our senses, i.e. perceptual knowledge. We tend to think that our sensory faculties are reliable, but perceptual knowledge can deceive us. This is because fundamentally perceptions are an &lt;em&gt;indirect&lt;/em&gt; way of gaining knowledge -- our perceived reality could be hallucinations undetectable from reality. This is the &lt;em&gt;argument from illusion&lt;/em&gt;. It is odd as it contradicts our intuitive sense that we are directly experiencing reality, hence we have a problem: could we ever directly directly perceive the physical world? This is the &lt;em&gt;problem of perception&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One response to this problem is &lt;em&gt;indirect realism&lt;/em&gt;, which embraces the apparent indirectness of our perception, and proclaims that we gain knowledge of the objective world by making inferences from our sense impressions. John Locke makes the distinction between primary and secondary qualities of an object perceived: a primary quality of an object is a quality independent of anyone perceiving the object e.g. shape, and a secondary quality is a quality dependent upon the perception of an object, e.g. color. Indirect realists use this notion to distinguish world-as-it-is and world-as-perceived. This view, however, threatens to dislocate ourselves from the world. Skeptics respond by the famous thought experiment of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;brain in a vat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: how do we know whether our perceived reality is simulated with a supercomputer? This is the &lt;em&gt;problem of the external world&lt;/em&gt;. How could I, in this case, infer anything at all about the objective world? Thus, there is no reason to assume so in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view that denies there is a world independent of our experience is &lt;em&gt;idealism&lt;/em&gt;, a famous exponent of which is George Berkeley. This position claims that perceptual knowledge is not knowledge of a world independent of perception, but knowledge of a world constituted by our perception of it. In this view, the world is constructed out of perception -- &amp;quot;to be is to be perceived.&amp;quot; However, idealist typically don&#39;t agree that the world cease to exist when no one is to perceive it. To avoid such dramatic consequence, Berkeley proclaims that there is a God who perceives everything, which does not convince me very much. Another version of idealism is &lt;em&gt;transcendental idealism&lt;/em&gt; by Immanuel Kant. Kant argues that although what we perceive may not be the world itself, we are required to suppose that there is an external world which gives rise to such experience, without which we cannot make sense of it. This sounds like indirect realism, but it is idealism in the sense that Kant rejects the possibility of gaining knowledge independent of experience through experience at all, directly or not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-priori-a-posteriori-and-problem-of-induction&#34;&gt;A Priori, A Posteriori, and Problem of Induction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We distinguish between a priori knowledge, knowledge gained independent of empircal investigation, and a posteriori knowledge i.e. empircal knowledge. For example, an important variety of a priori knowledge is introspection -- the examination of one&#39;s own psychology. All proposition that one could have a priori knowledge of, one could also have a posteriori knowledge of. From these knowledge, we could infer more with argument. The general types of arguments are: deduction, induction, abduction, analogy and fallacy. Inductive arguments infer from a large number of a posteriori knowledge, the sample, a general claim that goes beyond the sample. David Hume raised the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;problem of induction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which questions whether inductive arguments are justified. There seem that the only way to justify inductive arguments is by further use of the argument -- by observing the correlation between observed regularity in a large sample and unrestricted regularity. The justification of the inductive inference is circular. Some respond to the problem by claiming it is a fundamental epistemic practice, and some claim that it does not matter as long as inductive arguments work, but those defenses are hardly intellectually satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Popper&#39;s response to this problem is &lt;em&gt;critical rationalism&lt;/em&gt;: inductive inference are never used in science, instead they conjecture hypotheses, deductively infer consequences from them, and empiracally try to falsify the consequences. Therefore, scientists in fact use deductive inferences rather than inductive inferences. There are some problems with this position. One problem is in this view, we do not actually know the generalizations that scientists make, but only the falsity of the falsified theories. This would mean we don&#39;t know that the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; scientific theories are true, only that they have not been falsified yet. Another problem is that it is not clear how much counter evidence is needed to falsify a claim. If it is been observed for many years that emus are flightless, then a testimony that one has seen a flying emus does not necessarily constitude enough evidence to falsify that claim. An alternative approach is given by Hans Reichenbach&#39;s &lt;em&gt;pragmatism&lt;/em&gt;. Reichenbach agrees that there is no justification for inductive reference, but it is pragmatic to use it since it gives us a lot of true beliefs of the world, thus it is nevertheless a rational thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-of-other-minds&#34;&gt;Problem of Other Minds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take for granted that other people have minds like we do, but this is not entirely obvious. We cannot observe other minds like we observe objects, and we cannot experience other&#39;s perspective like we experience our own either. Thus, there is skepticism to whether other people also have the first person experience like &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do. This is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_other_minds&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;problem of other minds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most famous response is from John Stuart Mill, who make use of inductive reasoning. I observe that the behaviors of others mirror our own, from this I inductively infer that they have minds like I do. This is the &lt;em&gt;argument from analogy&lt;/em&gt;. There are problems with this argument as well. In the 1956 film &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049366/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invasion of the Body-Snatchers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, aliens quitely replace real people but they act and behave just like regular people, but they do not experience the world as we do. This points out the flaw in the argument from analogy: we cannot be sure just by observing behavior. In this argument, we could infer that things, such as a highly advanced robot, has a mind, when it is not clear if it is true. A series of videos on this topic (in Chinese) can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1D94y1m7Ft/?share_source=copy_web&amp;amp;vd_source=54d0c49d785d283eeaaec59f84aebba4&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;radical-skeptical-paradox&#34;&gt;Radical Skeptical Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A skeptical hypothesis is a scenario whereby one is severely deceived about the world but unable to detect such deception. In epistemology, skeptical hypotheses are used as a litmus test for any theory of knowledge. Thus skepticism is seen as a methodological devil&#39;s advocate. This gives rise to the &lt;em&gt;radical skeptical paradox&lt;/em&gt;: since we are unable to know the denials of skeptical hypotheses, we are unable to know anything of substance at all about the world. There is a lot more about this topic, but I&#39;m tired and I think I will stop here.&lt;/p&gt;

    Complex analysis is the good twin and real analysis the evil one: beautiful formulas and elegant theorems seem to blossom spontaneously in the complex domain, while toil and pathology rule the reals.

&lt;p&gt;This is an old post from 2022. We start by revisiting étale morphisms and introducing Grothendieck topologies and sites, and we define presheaves and sheaves on sites and show that they work almost the same as the usual presheaves and sheaves we are accostomed to. Then, we will define important sites such as the big and small Zariski sites and étale sites as well as the fppf site.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;math-body&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, we revisit the definitions and properties of étale morphisms of schemes.
A morphism of schemes $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is &lt;em&gt;étale&lt;/em&gt; if one of these equivalent conditions holds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$f$ is smooth and locally quasi-finite,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$f$ is smooth and unramified,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$f$ is flat and unramified,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$f$ is locally of finite presentation and formally étale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$f$ is locally of finite presentation and locally a standard étale morphism,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more equivalent definitions of étale morphisms listed on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tale_morphism&#34;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. Intuitively, I think of étale morphisms analogous to covering maps. We need this notion to define the étale topology which we will need to use later. As a side note, there is also something called the étale fundamental group, which also uses the notion of étale morphisms. We recall these properties of étale morphisms.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;math-body&#34;&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compotision of étale maps are étale,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if $f:Y\rightarrow X$ is étale then its base change $Y\times_XZ\rightarrow Z$ is étale,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if $f:Y\rightarrow X$ and $g:Z\rightarrow X$ are étale and $g=f\circ h$ where $h:Z\rightarrow Y$, then $h$ is étale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;given algebraically closed field $k$ and $k$-algebra $A$, then the morphism $\mathrm{Spec}(A)\rightarrow\mathrm{Spec}(k)$ is étale iff it is the disjoint union of spectra of finite separable field extensions of $k$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we are ready to define Grothendieck topology and sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grothendieck-topology-sites-and-topoi&#34;&gt;Grothendieck topology, sites, and topoi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that a presheaf (of sets) on a topological space $X$ is a contravariant functor $\mathscr{F}:\mathrm{Op}(X)\rightarrow\mathbf{Set}$, and a presheaf is a sheaf when $\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow\prod_{i}\mathscr{F}(U_i)\rightrightarrows\prod_{i,j}\mathscr{F}(U_i\cap U_j)$ is an equalizer for every open cover $\{U_{i}\}$ of any open $U\subseteq X$, which is equivalent to the identity and gluability axioms. We want to extend this from $\mathrm{Op}(X)$ to any category $\mathcal C$. To do this, we need to add some additional structure on the category $\mathcal C$ so that its objects can be viewed as &amp;quot;open sets&amp;quot; and morphisms can be viewed as &amp;quot;inclusions&amp;quot;. Grothendieck&#39;s insight is that we don&#39;t need the full strength of a topology to define sheaves, we only need intersections and a notion of when a collection of an open set forms an open cover of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;math-env style-defn&#34;

  &lt;span class=&#34;math-title&#34;
        data-label=&#39;Definition&#39;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;math-body&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Grothendieck topology&lt;/em&gt; on a category $\mathcal C$ is the data of a set of &lt;em&gt;coverings&lt;/em&gt; of $U$, written as $\mathrm{Cov}(U)$, for each object $U\in \mathcal C$, where each covering $S\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)$ is a set of morphisms of $\mathcal C$ with $U$ as targets, such that for all $U\in\mathcal C$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for each isomorphism $\varphi:V\rightarrow U$, we have $\{\varphi\}\in \mathrm{Cov}(U)$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if $\{V_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)$ and $\{W_{i,j}\rightarrow V_i\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(V_i)$ for each $i$, then $\{W_{i,j}\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for $\{V_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)$ and $W\rightarrow U$, all $W\times_UV_i$ exists and $\{W\times_UV_i\rightarrow W\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(W)$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A category $\mathcal C$ equipped with a choice of Grothendieck topology, also denoted $\mathcal C$, is a &lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt;. A continuous functor between sites $f:\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathcal D$ is a functor between their underlying categories such that for all $\{X_i\rightarrow X\}\in \mathrm{Cov}_{\mathcal C}(X)$ we have $\{f(X_i)\rightarrow f(X)\}\in \mathrm{Cov}_{\mathcal D}(f(X))$, and it commutes with finite fibred products if they exist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, $\mathrm{Op}(X)$ for a topological space $X$ can be made into a site using the usual notion of covering. We note that in $\mathrm{Op}(X)$ we have the fibered product $U\times_X V=U\cap V$ for all open $U,V\subseteq X$, which agrees with the usual notion of intersection. For a category $\mathcal C$ with $X\in\mathcal C$, the category of objects over $X$, denoted $\mathcal C/X$ is the category where objects are morphisms $Y\rightarrow X$ in $\mathcal C$ and morphisms between $Y_1\rightarrow X$ and $Y_2\rightarrow X$ are all morphisms $Y_1\rightarrow Y_2$ in $\mathcal C$ such that the obvious triangle commutes, i.e. $(Y_1\rightarrow Y_2\rightarrow X)=Y_1\rightarrow X$. If $\mathcal C$ is a site, then $\mathcal C/X$ can be given a site structure, by letting $\mathrm{Cov}(U\rightarrow X)$ in $\mathcal C/X$ be $\mathrm{Cov}(U)$ in $\mathcal C$. The site $\mathcal C/X$ is called the &lt;em&gt;localization&lt;/em&gt; of the site $\mathcal C$ at $X$. Suppose $X$ is a scheme, then we say that the &lt;em&gt;big Zariski (resp. big étale, resp. fppf) site&lt;/em&gt;, denoted $(\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{Zar}}$ (resp. $(\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{ét}}$, resp. $(\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{fppf}}$) of $X$, is the site with the category $\mathbf{Sch}/X$ and $\{Y_i\rightarrow Y\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)$ iff each $Y_i\rightarrow Y$ is an open immersion with $Y=\bigcup_i Y_i$ (resp. each $Y_i\rightarrow Y$ is étale with $\coprod_i Y_i\rightarrow Y$ surjective, resp. each $Y_i\rightarrow Y$ is flat and locally of finite presentation with $\coprod_i Y_i\rightarrow Y$ surjective). An element of $\mathrm{Cov}(U\rightarrow X)$ is called a &lt;em&gt;Zariski cover&lt;/em&gt; (resp. &lt;em&gt;étale cover&lt;/em&gt;, resp. &lt;em&gt;fppf cover&lt;/em&gt;) of $U$. The small Zariski site (resp. small étale site) of $X$, denoted $X_{\mathrm{Zar}}$ (resp. $X_{\mathrm{ét}}$) is the site whose category is the full subcategory of $\mathrm{Sch}/X$ where each object $U\rightarrow X$ is an open immersion (resp. étale), and the coverings are the same as the big Zariski (resp. big étale) site. The small Zariski site of $X$ is equivalent to the site $\mathrm{Op}(X)$. Moreover, we have the following inclusions
&lt;/p&gt;
$$\{\mathrm{Zariski\ cover}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{étale\ cover}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{fppf\ cover}\}$$&lt;p&gt;Next, we discuss presheaves and sheaves on a site. This whole business is to get new cohomology theories such as étale cohomology, because basic sheaf cohomology is insufficient for our needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        data-label=&#39;Definition&#39;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;math-body&#34;&gt;
    A &lt;em&gt;presheaf&lt;/em&gt; (of sets) on a site $\mathcal C$ is a contravariant functor $\mathscr{F}:\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathbf{Set}$, and a presheaf is a &lt;em&gt;sheaf&lt;/em&gt; iff $\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow\prod_{i}\mathscr{F}(U_i)\rightrightarrows\prod_{i,j}\mathscr{F}(U_i\times_U U_j)$ is an equalizer for all $U\in\mathcal C$ and $\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)$. A presheaf is called &lt;em&gt;separated&lt;/em&gt; if for all $U\in\mathcal C$ and $\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)$, the map $\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow \prod_i\mathscr{F}(U_i)$ is injective. We write $\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)$ (resp. $\mathrm{PSh}(\mathcal C)$) for the category of sheaves (resp. presheaves) of the site $\mathcal C$.
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that a separated presheaf can be viewed as a presheaf that only satisfies one of the axioms of a sheaf, the identity axiom, but not necessaily the gluability axiom, therefore we have the obvious inclusions
&lt;/p&gt;
$$\{\mathrm{sheaves}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{separated\ presheaves}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{presheaves}\}$$&lt;p&gt;all of which admits left adjoints, the composition of them being sheafification. Usually, we can formulate sheafification in terms of compatible germs, but since we are working over sites, it does not make sense to take a point in an object and take the product of stalks. The way we construct the adjoint from presheaves to separated presheaves is to map a presheaf $\mathscr{F}$ to $\mathscr{F}^{\mathrm s}(U)=\mathscr{F}(U)/\sim$ where $a\sim b$ iff exists $\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)$ such that $a,b$ are mapped to the same element by the map $\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow \prod_i\mathscr{F}(U_i)$. We can check that this is in fact a separated presheaf. All of the above works for (pre)sheaves of rings, abelian groups, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class=&#34;math-body&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;topos&lt;/em&gt; is a category equivalent to $\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)$ for a site $\mathcal C$. A morphism of topoi $f:\mathcal{T}_1\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_2$ is an adjoint pair $f^*\dashv f_*$ of functors $f^*:\mathcal{T}_1\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_2$ and $f_*:\mathcal{T}_2\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_1$ with a choice of natural isomorphism
&lt;/p&gt;
$$\Phi:\mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal T_1}(f^*(-),-)\rightarrow \mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal T_2}(-,f_*(-))$$&lt;p&gt;where each naturality here means $\Phi$ is natural in each of the two dashes, and $f^*$ commutes with finite limits when they exist. Define composition in the obvious way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We remark that in the above definition, commuting with finite limits is equivalent to checking that $f^*$ commutes with finite products and preserve equalizers. In many cases, though not always, a continuous functor between sites $f:\mathcal C\rightarrow \mathcal D$ induces a functor $f_*:\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal D)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)$ by $f_*(\mathscr{F})(X)=\mathscr{F}(f(X))$, where the well-definedness follows from $\mathscr{F}(f(U_i\times_U U_j))=\mathscr{F}(f(U_i)\times_{f(U)} f(U_j))$ for any $\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)$, as illustrated by the diagram&lt;/p&gt;

    If $\mathcal C,\mathcal D$ are sites with small underlying categories, then the functor $f_*:\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal D)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)$ induced by a continuous functor $f:\mathcal C\rightarrow \mathcal D$ admits a left adjoint $f^*:\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal D)$. If, further, that finite limits in $\mathcal C$ are representable and $f$ commutes with them, then $f^*$ commutes with finite limits.

    &lt;p&gt;We construct this functor concretely. For each $U\in\mathcal D$, let $\mathcal I_U$ be the category where objects are pairs $\langle V,\rho\rangle$ where $V\in\mathcal C$ and $\rho\in \mathrm{Mor}_\mathcal{D}(U,f(V))$, and a morphism $g:\langle V_1,\rho_1\rangle \rightarrow \langle V_2,\rho_2\rangle$ is a morphism $g:V_1\rightarrow V_2$ in $\mathcal C$ such that $(fg)\circ\rho_1=\rho_2$. We define
&lt;/p&gt;
$$f^* (\mathscr{F})(U)=\lim_{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\langle V,\rho\rangle\in\mathcal I_{U}^\mathrm{op}}}\mathscr{F}(V)$$&lt;p&gt;
and for each $h:U_1\rightarrow U_2$ in $\mathcal C$, there is functor $\mathcal I_{U_2}\rightarrow \mathcal I_{U_1}$ given by $\langle V,\rho\rangle\mapsto \langle V,\rho\circ h\rangle$ which induces a morphism $f^*(\mathscr{F})(U_2)\rightarrow f^*(\mathscr{F})(U_1)$. We can check that this is well-defined.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;yh-pullquote-attrib&#34;&gt;— Alexander Grothendieck&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an old post from 2024. In this post, we present a proof of van Kampen theorem in algebraic topology that is different from the standard proof in most texts. This is a proof due to Grothendieck and it generalizes better into algebraic geometry, which is an algebraic analogue known as the étale fundamental group. This proof is shorter, more conceptual (uses universal properties without invoking concrete generators and relations), and uses covering spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let $X$ be a topological space with all the nice connectedness properties, in particular, we assume it has a universal covering $u:\widetilde{X}\rightarrow X$. Let $G$ be a group, $x\in X$, and $\rho:\pi_1(X,x)\rightarrow G$ a homomorphism. We define a based $G$-covering $p_{\rho}:(Y_\rho,y_\rho)\rightarrow (X,x)$. Take the product $\widetilde{X}\times G$ with $G$ having the discrete topology, and $\pi_1(X,x)$ acts on it by $\sigma\cdot(z,g)=(\sigma\cdot z,g\rho(\sigma^{-1}) )$. Take $Y_\rho=(\widetilde{X}\times G)/\pi_1(X,x)$ by this action, and $y_{\rho}$ the image of $(\widetilde{x},1)$. Note that we have $(\sigma\cdot z,g)=(z,g\rho(\sigma))$ in $Y_\rho$. Let $p_\rho:Y_{\rho}\rightarrow X$ be $(z,g)\mapsto u(z)$. The group $G$ acts on $Y_\rho$ by $h\cdot (z,g)=(z,hg)$ evenly, making $Y_{\rho}$ a $G$-covering. Conversely, suppose $p:(Y,y)\rightarrow (X,x)$ is a $G$-covering, we constrct a morphism $\pi_1(X,x)\rightarrow G$. For $\sigma\in \pi_1(X,x)$, we let $\rho(\sigma)$ be the element that acts by $\rho(\sigma)\cdot y=y*\sigma$ where $y*\sigma$ is the end point of the path that lifts $\sigma$.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This construction gives a bijection
&lt;/p&gt;
$$\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_1(X,x),G)\leftrightarrow \{G\textrm{-coverings}\ \textrm{of}\ (X,x)\}$$&lt;p&gt; up to isomorphisms.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking this is routine. Let $X=U\cup V$ with $U,V$ path-connected and intersect nontrivially, with base point $x\in U\cap V$. Suppose there are coverings $p:\widetilde{U}\rightarrow U$ and $q:\widetilde{V}\rightarrow V$ and an isomorphism $\nu:p^{-1}(U\cap V)\rightarrow q^{-1}(U\cap V)$, then one can glue them together to a covering of $X$, by taking $\widetilde{X}=\widetilde{U}\times\widetilde{V}/(\nu(y_1)\sim \nu(y_2))$. We can generalize this to the case where $X$ is the union of a family of open sets, in which case we require a cocycle condition to be satisfied in order to be able to glue the covering spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

    For any $h_1:\pi_1(U,x)\rightarrow G$ and $h_2:\pi_1(V,x)\rightarrow G$ with $h_1\circ i_1=h_2\circ i_2$ where $i_1,i_2$ are induced by inclusions $U\cap V\hookrightarrow U $ and $U\cap V\hookrightarrow V $, there exists a unique morphism $h:\pi_1(X,x)\rightarrow G$ such that $h\circ j_1=h_1$ and $h\circ j_2=h_2$ where $j_1,j_2$ are induced by inclusions $U\hookrightarrow X$ and $V\hookrightarrow X$.
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagrammically, this is saying $\pi_1(X,x)$ is a fibred coproduct in the category of groups, which is a free product with amalgamation,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homomorphisms $h_1,h_2$ determine $G$-coverings $Y_1\rightarrow U$ and $Y_2\rightarrow V$. The commutativity of the square means that their restrictions to $U\cap V$ are isomorphic $G$-coverings, thus by previous work, they glue to a covering which restricts to $U,V$. This is given by a $h:\pi_1(X,x)\rightarrow G$ which is precisely the morphism desired.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If $U\cap V$ is simply connected then
&lt;/p&gt;
$$\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_1(X,x),G)=\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_1(U,x),G)\times \mathrm{Hom}(\pi_1(V,x),G)$$&lt;p&gt; which implies $\pi_1(X,x)$ is a free product.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth mentioning that this proof is an example of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(mathematics)&#34;&gt;descent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an old post from 2023. Recall that for a topological space $X$, a fibre bundle of fibres $F$ where $F$ is a topological space, is a topological space $E$, with a surjective map $\pi: E\rightarrow X$ such that for all $x\in X$, exists an open nbhd $x\in U\subseteq X$ such that there is a homeomorphism $\varphi: \pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U\times F$ such that $\mathrm{pr}_U\circ \varphi=\pi|_{\pi^{-1}(U)}$ where $\mathrm{pr}_U:U\times F\rightarrow U$ is the projection onto $U$. Fibre bundles generalize vector bundles and covering spaces. In this post, we interpret this algebraically and generalize this notion to schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;symmetric-algebra-and-quasi-coherent-bundles&#34;&gt;Symmetric Algebra and Quasi-coherent Bundles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that for $M$ an $A$-module, its tensor algebra is the graded algebra $T(M)=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}T^n(M)$ where $T^n(M)=M^{\otimes n}$. The symmetric algebra is the algebra $\mathrm{Sym}(M)=T(M)/I$ where $I$ is the ideal generated by the set $\{m\otimes n-n\otimes m:m,n\in M\}$, which is a graded algebra $\mathrm{Sym}(M)=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathrm{Sym}^n(M)$ since $I$ is homogeneous. Note that $\mathrm{Sym}^0(M)=A$ and $\mathrm{Sym}^1(M)=M$, so there is a map $i:\mathrm{Sym}^1(M)=M\rightarrow \mathrm{Sym}(M)$. The symmetric algebra has the universal property that the precomposition $\varphi\mapsto \varphi\circ i$ induces a bijection for every $A$-algebra $B$.&lt;/p&gt;
$$\mathrm{Hom}_{A-\mathrm{Alg}}(\mathrm{Sym}(M),B)\rightarrow\mathrm{Hom}_{A-\mathrm{Mod}}(M,B)$$&lt;p&gt;Setting $B=\mathrm{Sym}(N)$, we see from this that we can find $\mathrm{Sym}(u):\mathrm{Sym}(M)\rightarrow\mathrm{Sym}(N)$ which is a graded morphism, so $\mathrm{Sym}$ is a functor from the category of $A$-modules to the category of graded $A$-algebras. We globalize this construction to schemes. Let $X$ be a scheme (a more generally a ringed space), and $\mathcal E$ and $\mathcal O_X$-module, then define the graded $\mathcal O_X$-algebra $\mathrm{Sym}(\mathcal E)=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathrm{Sym}^n(\mathcal E)$ be the sheafification of $U\mapsto \mathrm{Sym}_{\Gamma(U,\mathcal O_X)}(\Gamma(U,\mathcal E))$, and similarly we have a bijection&lt;/p&gt;
$$\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal O_X-\mathrm{Alg}}(\mathrm{Sym}(\mathcal E), \mathcal A)\rightarrow \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal O_X-\mathrm{Mod}}(\mathcal E, \mathcal A)$$&lt;p&gt;Let $\mathcal B$ be a quasicoherent $\mathcal O_X$-algebra. There exists an $X$-scheme $\underline{\mathrm{Spec}}(\mathcal B)$, such that for all $X$-schemes $f:T\rightarrow X$ there are bijections functorial in $T$ of the following form&lt;/p&gt;
$$\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Sch}/X}(T,\underline{\mathrm{Spec}}(\mathcal B))\rightarrow\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal O_X-\mathrm{Alg}}(\mathcal B,f_*\mathcal O_T)$$&lt;p&gt;In other words, the functor $(\mathrm{Sch}/X)^{\mathrm{op}}\rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$ given by $(f: T \rightarrow X) \mapsto \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X-\mathrm{Alg}}\left(\mathcal{B}, f_* \mathcal{O}_T\right)$ is representable. To see this, we note that this is a sheaf on the Zariski site, since $f_*$ and $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal B,-)$ are left-exact. We also have this is covered by representable open subfunctors. More concretely, the points of $\underline{\mathrm{Spec}}(\mathcal B)$ above $x\in X$ is that of $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathcal \Gamma(B,\mathcal O_X)\otimes \kappa(p))$ and the topology above an open affine $U=\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ is $\mathrm{Spec}(\Gamma(U,\mathcal B))$. For every quasi-coherent $\mathcal O_X$-module $\mathcal E$, we define $\mathbb V(\mathcal E)=\underline{\mathrm{Spec}}(\mathrm{Sym}(\mathcal E))$ functorial in $E$ which the call the quasi-coherent bundle associated to $E$. When restricted to locally free $\mathcal O_X$-modules, this functor provides a correspondance to algebraic vector bundles, where algebraic vector bundles are understood as follows,&lt;/p&gt;

    A vector bundle of rank $n\in\mathbb N$ on $X$ is an $X$-scheme $V$ with an equivalence class of families $(U_i, c_i)$ where $(U_i)_i$ is an open cover of $V$ and isomorphisms $c_i:V|_{U_i}\rightarrow \mathbb A^{n}_{U_i}$ of $U_i$-schemes, such that for all $i,j$, the automorphisms $c_i\circ c_j:\mathbb A^n_{U_i\cap U_j}\rightarrow \mathbb A^n_{U_i\cap U_j}$ are linear, where two such families, called atlases, are equivalent if their union is an atlas. Moreover, define a morphisms of vector bundles $(V,U_i,c_i)\rightarrow (V^\prime,U^\prime_i,c^\prime_i)$ as a $X$-morphism $f:V\rightarrow V^\prime$ such that $c^\prime_j\circ f\circ c_i^{-1}:\mathbb A^n_{U_i\cap U^\prime_j}\rightarrow \mathbb A^n_{U_i\cap U^\prime_j}$ is linear.
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locally free $\mathcal O_X$-modules are interpreted as sheaf of sections over the vector bundle. More specifically, for a vector bundle $E$ as above, we define a locally free $\mathcal O_X$-module $\mathcal E_V$ as the following. Define the sheaf $\mathcal P( V/X)$ of abelian groups by attaching to $U\subseteq X$ the sections of $V$ over $U$, that is, morphisms $s:U\rightarrow V|_U$ with $f\circ s=\mathrm{id}_U$, and restrictions are given by restrictions of scheme morphisms. Locally, this has the structure of $\mathcal O_X^n$ which gives the module structure. This gives the inverse to $\mathbb V(-)$. This correspondance is part of what is known as Serre-Swan theorem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an important question to determine the configuration of zeros and poles of a rational (or meromorphic) function. Let $X$ be an integral scheme (i.e. reduced and irreducible). We denote by $\mathcal K_X$ the constant sheaf on $X$ with value the function field $K(X)$ of $X$.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;math-body&#34;&gt;
    A Cartier divisor on $X$ is a family $(U_i,f_i)$ where $(U_i)_i$ is an open cover of $X$ and $f_i\in K(X)^\times$ with $f_if_j^{-1}\in \Gamma(U_i\cap U_j,\mathcal O_X^\times) $ for all $i,j$, where two families $(U_i,f_i)$, $(V_i,g_i)$ give rise to the same Cariter divisor if $f_ig_j^{-1}\in\Gamma(U_i\cap V_j,\mathcal O_X^\times)$ for all $i,j$. The Cartier divisors form an abelian group $\mathrm{Div}(X)$, where adding the family $(U_i,f_i)$ and $(V_i,g_i)$ gives $(U_i\cap V_j,f_ig_j)$. A Cartier divisor is principle if it is given by some $(X,f)$, and two divisors $D,E$ are linearly equivalent if $D-E$ is principle.
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alernatively, we can set $\mathrm{Div}(X)=\Gamma(X,\mathcal K_X^\times/\mathcal O_X^\times)$, and principle divisors the ones in the image of $\Gamma(X,\mathcal K_X^\times)$. We call the ones in $\Gamma(X,(\mathcal K_X^\times\cap \mathcal O_X)/\mathcal O_X^\times)$ effective divisors and denote it by $D\ge 0$. Let $\mathrm{Cl}(X)$ denote $\mathrm{Div}(X)$ modulo the principle divisors, which we call the divisor class group. We have a short exact sequence.
&lt;/p&gt;
$$1\longrightarrow \Gamma(X,\mathcal O_X)^\times\longrightarrow K(X)\longrightarrow \mathrm{Div}(X) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}(X)\longrightarrow 0$$&lt;p&gt;To a Cartier divisor $D$, we associate the line bundle $\mathcal O_X(D)$ for all open $V\subseteq X$.
&lt;/p&gt;
$$\Gamma(V,\mathcal O_X(D))=\{f\in K(X): \forall i,f_if\in \Gamma(U_i\cap V,\mathcal O_X)\}$$&lt;p&gt;This association $D\mapsto \mathcal O_X(D)$ induces an isomorphism $\mathrm{Cl}(X)\cong \mathrm{Pic}(X)$. Call an invertible $\mathcal O_X$-submodule of $\mathcal K_X$ an invertible fractional ideal of $\mathcal O_X$. Then we can associate a Cartier divisor $D$ an invertible fractional ideal $\mathcal F_X(D)$ such that $\mathcal F_X(D) (U_i)=f_i\mathcal O_X$. This correspondance provides an isomorphism between $\mathrm{Div}(X)$ and the invertible fractional ideal on $X$. Cartier divisors considered more geometrically is so called Weil divisors. Let $Z^k(X)$ be the free abelian group generated on the set of closed integral subscheme of codimension $k$. The elements of $Z^1(X)$ are then called Weil divisors and their generators called the prime divisors, and the ones with nonnegative coefficients are called the effective Weil divisors. We now connect Weil divisors with Cartier divisors with a homomorphism $\mathrm{cyc}: \mathrm{Div}(X)\rightarrow Z^1(X) $. To this end, we need to define, for a prime Weil divisor $C$, the order $\mathrm{ord}_C(f)$ for some meromorphic function $f\in \Gamma(U,\mathcal K_X)$ where the generic point $\xi$ of $C$ is contained in $C$. If the local ring $\mathcal O_{X,C}=\mathcal O_{X,\xi}$ is a DVR, for example, when $X$ is normal, then we can just set $\mathrm{ord}_C(f)=\nu (f)$ the normalized discrete valuation of $f$. In general, the local ring is a local noetherian ring of dimension $1$. For a nonzero $f\in \mathrm{Frac}(\mathcal O_{X,C})$ where $f=a/b$ we set $\mathrm{ord}_C(f)=\mathrm{lg}(\mathcal O_{X,C}/(a))-\mathrm{lg}(\mathcal O_{X,C}/(b))$. For a Cartier divisor $D$, we choose some element of its atlas $(U_i,f_i)$ where $\xi_C\in U_i$, and define $\mathrm{ord}_C(D)=\mathrm{ord}_C(f_i)$, and then we can define $\mathrm{cyc}(D)=\sum_C\mathrm{ord}_C(D)\left[C\right]$. This provides the desired correspondance. Like Cartier divisors, we can associate to each Weil divisor $D$, a fractional ideal $\mathcal L$ where
&lt;/p&gt;
$$\Gamma(U,\mathcal L)=\{f\in \mathcal K_X(U): \mathrm{div}(f)+D\ge 0\}$$&lt;p&gt; which is the same one as the one with the corresponding Cartier divisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;torsors&#34;&gt;Torsors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a sheaf $T$ on some $X$ and a sheaf of groups $G$ on $X$, we say $T$ is a $G$-torsor if $G$ acts on $T$ simply transitively and $X$ has an open cover $(U_i)_i$ such that $T(U_i)$ is nonempty for all $i$. The sheaf cohomology $H^1(X,G)$ classifies the $G$-torsors. For a locally free $\mathcal O_X$-module $\mathcal E$ of rank $n$. The sheaf $\mathrm{Isom}(\mathcal O_X^n,\mathcal E)$ is a $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathcal O_X)$-torsor by $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathcal O_X)(U)$ acts on $\mathrm{Isom}(\mathcal O_X^n,\mathcal E)(U)$ by $g\cdot u\mapsto u\circ g^{-1}$. We have a bijection between rank $n$ vector bundles and $H^1(X,\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathcal O_X))$, so rank $n$ vector bundles are identified with $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathcal O_X)$-torsors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uniformization Theorem for Elliptic Curves</title>

    The pursuit of mathematics is a divine madness of the human spirit.

&lt;p&gt;This is an old post from 2024. In this post, we prove the uniformization theorem for elliptic curves. The theorem states that every elliptic curve over the complex numbers arose from the complex plane modulo a lattice, and vice versa. In fact there is an isomorphism between them which is both complex analytic and algebraic. This shows that elliptic curves over complex numbers is a torus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lattice $L=[\omega_1,\omega_2]\subseteq \mathbb C$ is an additive subgroup $\omega_1\mathbb Z+\omega_2\mathbb Z\subseteq \mathbb C$ with $\omega_1,\omega_2$ linearly independent. For example, if $\mathcal O=\mathbb Z[\tau]$ is an imaginary quadratic order, the it gives rise to lattice $[1,\tau]$. An elliptic function for a lattice $L$ is a meromorphic function $f:D\subseteq \mathbb C\rightarrow\mathbb C$ that is doubly-periodic w.r.t. $L$, i.e. $f(z+\omega)=f(z)$ for all $\omega\in L$. Elliptic functions form a field $\mathbb C(L)$. We recall Cauchy&#39;s principle argument.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;math-body&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let $\gamma$ be a simply closed positively oriented curve with interior $\Gamma$. Let $f$ be a function meromorphic on an open set $\Omega$ containing $\Gamma$ and $\gamma$ that has no zero or pole on $\gamma$, and $g$ a nonzero function holomorphic on $\Omega$, then for $z_0\in\Gamma$ &lt;/p&gt;
$$\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\gamma}g(z)\frac{f^\prime(z)}{f(z)}\mathrm dz=\sum_{\omega\in \Gamma}g(z_0)\mathrm{ord}_{w}(f)$$&lt;p&gt; when $g(z)=1$, the rhs is the difference between the number of zeros and poles in $\Omega$.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theorem is proved by writing $f,g$ in terms of their Laurent series about $z_0$ and using Residue theorem. A corollary from this is that in any fundamental paralellogram $F_{\alpha}=\alpha+\{t_1\omega_1+t_2\omega_2:0\le t_1,t_2&lt;1\}$, the number of poles is equal to the number of zeros.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Let $L$ be a lattice and $k&gt;2$ an integer. The Einsenstein series of weight $k$ is &lt;/p&gt;
$$G_{k}(L)=\sum_{\omega\in L\setminus\{0\}}\frac{1}{\omega^k}$$&lt;p&gt; Consider lattices $[1,\tau]$ for $\tau\in\mathbb H$ where $\mathbb H=\{z\in\mathbb C:\mathrm{Im}(z)&gt;0\}$ is the upper-half plane, we define $G_{k}(\tau)=G_{k}([1,\tau])$, so that $G_k$ is a funciton on the upper-half plane $\mathbb H$.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If $k$ is odd then the term $\frac{1}{\omega^k}$ cancels with $\frac{1}{(-\omega)^k}$, so the only interesting Einsenstein series are those of even weight. The Einsenstein series converges absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A Weierstrass $\wp$-function of a lattice $L$ is &lt;/p&gt;
$$\wp(z ; L)=\frac{1}{z^2}+\sum_{\omega \in L^*}\left(\frac{1}{(z-\omega)^2}-\frac{1}{\omega^2}\right)$$&lt;p&gt; we write $\wp(z)$ when there is no confusion of the lattice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $\wp$-function has a pole of order $w$ at each lattice point, and these are all the poles. Its derivative is&lt;/p&gt;
$$\wp^\prime(z)=-2\sum_{\omega\in L}\frac{1}{(z-\omega)^3}$$&lt;p&gt;It follows that $\wp, \wp^\prime$ are elliptic functions. We will now derive a differential equation that reveals its link to elliptic curves. By expanding the $\wp$-function into series, we can write it in terms of Einsenstein series. &lt;/p&gt;
$$\wp(z)=\frac{1}{z^2}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(2 n+1) G_{2 n+2}(L) z^{2 n}$$&lt;p&gt;The critical observation is that $\wp $ satisfies the following differential equations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;math-body&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let $L$ be a lattice, then &lt;/p&gt;
$$\wp^{\prime}(z)^2=4 \wp(z)^3-g_2(L) \wp(z)-g_3(L),$$&lt;p&gt; where $g_2(L)=60G_4(L)$ and $g_3(L)=140 G_6(L)$&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This corresponds to an elliptic curve by letting $y=\wp^\prime(z)$ and $x=\wp(z)$, so we have an elliptic curve $y^2=4 x^3-g_2(L) x-g_3(L)$, iff the discriminant $\Delta(L)=g_2(L)^3-27g_3(L)^2$ is nonzero, and this is always nonzero. We now have a map that gives an elliptic curve for each lattice&lt;/p&gt;
$$\Phi:\mathbb C/L\rightarrow E(\mathbb C)\quad z\mapsto (\wp(z),\wp^\prime(z))$$&lt;p&gt;This is an isomorphism of groups and complex manifolds. Moreover, all elliptic curves arise this way. For a proof, consult &lt;a href=&#34;https://math.mit.edu/classes/18.783/2015/LectureNotes16.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, becuase I&#39;m too lazy to prove the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive affirmative commands do not follow the usual rules above, instead, pronouns comes after the verb connected with a hyphen, e.g. &amp;quot;Regarde-moi&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Vas-y&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Montre-la-leur&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Levons-nous&amp;quot;. In negatative affirmative commands, they revert to the usual order, e.g. &amp;quot;Ne parle pas&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ne t’en va pas&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clitics must be ordered as (me / te / se / nous /vous) + (le / la / les) + (lui / leur) + y + en, e.g. &amp;quot;Je te le donne&amp;quot;, but you don&#39;t need to worry about the order of two pronouns in the same slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three or more clitics together is very rare and usually only occur in certain combos such as &amp;quot;Il m’y en a laissé&amp;quot;, so avoid three or more clitics together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feminization:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular:&lt;/strong&gt; +e&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular:&lt;/strong&gt; (-eur → -euse, -rice), (-teur → -trice), (-er, -ier → -ère, -ière)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular (Doubling):&lt;/strong&gt; (-en → -enne), (-on → -onne), (-an → -anne), (-in → -inne), (-el → -elle), (-eil → -eille), (-il → -ille), (-et → -ette), (-ot → -otte), (-as → -asse), (-os → -osse), (-ais / -ois → -aisse / -oisse)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invariant:&lt;/strong&gt; journaliste, secrétaire, architecte, élève, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptions:&lt;/strong&gt; (époux → épouse), (roi → reine), (gars → fille), (homme → femme)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;number&#34;&gt;Number&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pluralization:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular:&lt;/strong&gt; → +s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular:&lt;/strong&gt; (-al, -ail → -aux), (-eu, -eau, -au, -ou, -eu → +x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invariant:&lt;/strong&gt; -s, -x, -z → invariant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptions:&lt;/strong&gt; (œil → yeux), (ciel → cieux), (Monsieur → Messieurs), (Madame → Mesdames), (Mademoiselle → Mesdemoiselles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;derivation&#34;&gt;Derivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Verbs:&lt;/strong&gt; -tion / -sion, -age, -ment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Adjectives:&lt;/strong&gt; -té, -eur / -rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adjectives&#34;&gt;Adjectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pluralization:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular:&lt;/strong&gt; → +s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invariant:&lt;/strong&gt; -s, -x, -z → invariant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feminization:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular:&lt;/strong&gt; → +e&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular:&lt;/strong&gt; (-eux → -euse), (-if → -ive), (-er → -ère), (-el → -elle), (-il → -ille), (-en → -enne), (-on → -onne), (-as → -asse), (-os → -osse), (-et → -ette), (-c → -que), (-g → -gue)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invariant:&lt;/strong&gt; -e → invariant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptions:&lt;/strong&gt; (bon → bonne), (blanc → blanche), (fou → folle), (beau → belle), (nouveau → nouvelle), (vieux → vieille), (sec → sèche)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substantivization:&lt;/strong&gt; With a determiner, adj. becomes noun phrase, e.g. les riches, les pauvres, un jeune (garçon), une jeune (fille), les jeunes, les vieux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparatives and Superlatives:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparatives: (plus / aussi / moins) + adj + que&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irregular Comparatives: (bon → meilleur(e)), (bien → mieux), (mauvais → pire / plus mauvais)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superlatives: (le / la / les) + (plus / moins) + adj&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irregular Superlatives: bon → (le / la / les) + meilleur(e)(s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past Participles as Adjectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Fully adjectival past participle can be treated same as adjectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adverbs&#34;&gt;Adverbs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;simple-adverbs-and-derived-adverbs&#34;&gt;Simple Adverbs and Derived Adverbs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Adverbs:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bien, mal, vite, très, peu, déjà, souvent, toujours, bientôt, hier, demain, ici, là, partout, ailleurs, tôt, tard, encore, alors, donc, enfin, peut-être, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adverbs Derived from Adjectives:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the adjective has a distinct feminine form → use the feminine as the base + ment: lent → lente → lentement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irregulars: (-ant → -amment), (-ent → -emment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small group with -ément: bref → brièvement, énorme → énormément, profond → profondément, précis → précisément.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interrogative-and-negative-adverbs&#34;&gt;Interrogative and Negative Adverbs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Interrogative Adverbs:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comment = how, in what way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;où = where&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quand = when&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pourquoi = why&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combien = how much, how many&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locutional Interrogative Adverbs:&lt;/strong&gt; built on simple interrogative adverbs with prepositions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative Adverbs (ne ... X):&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pas, plus, jamais, guère, point, rien, personne (rien &amp;amp; personne are pronoun-like but function as negative adverbials in “ne … rien / ne … personne”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;verbs&#34;&gt;Verbs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verbs carry and conjugate according to person (1,2,3), number (sg.pl.), tense (present, future, etc), and mood (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, etc), where the first two need to agree with subject. Every verb has four non-finite forms: Infinitive, Past participle, Present participle (-ant), Gérondif (en + present participle). They are categoriesed into three groups: 1. -er (except aller), 2. -ir, 3. all others. These are complicated and will be an entire new post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post we test markdown syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;Paragraph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Aque venitatiusda cum&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;voluptionse latur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;sitiae dolessi aut parist&amp;quot; &lt;code&gt;aut dollo&lt;/code&gt; enim qui &lt;code&gt;voluptate ma&lt;/code&gt; dolestendit peritin re plis aut quas inctum laceat est volestemque commosa as cus endigna tectur, offic to cor sequas etum rerum idem sintibus eiur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中文段落测试。&lt;em&gt;君不见黄河之水天上来&lt;/em&gt;，&lt;strong&gt;奔流到海不复回&lt;/strong&gt;。
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;君不见高堂明镜悲白发，朝如青丝暮成雪&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;。
人生得意须尽欢，&lt;code&gt;莫使金樽空对月&lt;/code&gt;。
天生我材必有用，千金散尽还复来。
烹羊宰牛且为乐，会须一饮三百杯。
岑夫子，丹丘生，将进酒，杯莫停。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blockquotes&#34;&gt;Blockquotes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiam, ad mint andaepu dandae nostion secatur sequo quae.
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; that you can use &lt;em&gt;Markdown syntax&lt;/em&gt; within a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; that you can put a blockquote inside a blockquote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;　　&lt;em&gt;列位看官&lt;/em&gt;，&lt;strong&gt;你道此书&lt;/strong&gt;从何而来？说起根由&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;虽近荒唐&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;，细谙则深有趣味。待在下将此来历注明，方使闻者了然不惑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;　　原来，当年女娲氏炼石补天之时，于大荒山无稽崖炼成高经十二丈，方经二十四丈顽石三万六千五百零一块。娲皇氏只用了三万六千五百块，只单单剩了一块未用，便弃在此山青埂峰下。谁知此石自经煅炼之后，灵性已通，因见众石俱得补天，独自己无材不堪入选，遂自怨自嗟，日夜悲号惭愧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;　　一日，正当嗟悼之馀，俄见一僧一道远远而来，生得骨骼不凡，丰神迥异，说说笑笑来至峰下，坐于石边高谈快论。先是说些云山雾海神仙玄幻之事，后便说到红尘中荣华富贵。此石听了，不觉打动凡心，也想要到人间去享一享这荣华富贵，但自恨粗蠢，不得已，便口吐人言，向那僧道说道：“大师，弟子蠢物，不能见礼了。适闻二位谈那人世间荣耀繁华，心切慕之。弟子质虽粗蠢，性却稍通，况见二师仙形道体，定非凡品，必有补天济世之材，利物济人之德。如蒙发一点慈心，携带弟子得入红尘，在那富贵场中，温柔乡里受享几年，自当永佩洪恩，万劫不忘也。”二仙师听毕，齐憨笑道：“善哉，善哉！那红尘中有却有些乐事，但不能永远依恃。况又有美中不足、好事多魔八个字紧相连属，瞬息间则又乐极悲生，人非物换，究竟是到头一梦，万境归空，倒不如不去的好。”这石凡心已炽，那里听得进这话去，乃复苦求再四。二仙知不可强制，乃叹道：“此亦静极思动，无中生有之数也。既如此，我们便携你去受享受享，只是到不得意时，切莫后悔。”石道：“自然，自然。”那僧又道：“若说你性灵，却又如此质蠢，并更无奇贵之处。如此也只好踮脚而已。也罢，我如今大施佛法助你助，待劫终之日，复还本质，以了此案。你道好否？”石头听了，感谢不尽。那僧便念咒书符，大展幻术，将一块大石登时变成一块鲜明莹洁的美玉，且又缩成扇坠大小的可佩可拿。那僧托于掌上，笑道：“形体倒也是个宝物了！还只没有实在的好处，须得再镌上数字，使人一见便知是奇物方妙。然后携你到那昌明隆盛之邦，诗礼簪缨之族，花锦繁华之地，温柔富贵之乡去安身乐业。”石头听了，喜不能禁，乃问：“不知弟子那几件奇处，又不知携了弟子到何处？望乞明示，使弟子不惑。”那僧笑道：“你且莫问，日后自然明白的。”说着，便袖了那石，同那道人飘然而去，竟不知投奔何方何舍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;palatino-paragraph&#34;&gt;Palatino Paragraph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;palatino&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;　　&lt;em&gt;Call me Ishmael&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Some years&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ago—never&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;　　There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;　　Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
