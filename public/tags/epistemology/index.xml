    Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is -- insofar as it is thinkable at all -- primitive and muddled.
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;yh-pullquote-attrib&#34;&gt;— Albert Einstein &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, epistemology is a branch of philosophy which studies knowledge. It concerns problems such as: how is knowledge defined (what does it mean to know something)? What is the value of knowledge? What is the structure of knowledge? I became interested in epistemology recently and have started reading Duncan Pritchard&#39;s introductory text &lt;em&gt;What is This Thing Called Knowledge?&lt;/em&gt; I can&#39;t help but want to write down some of the things I&#39;ve learned from my reading. In this post, I will talk about some key ideas from  Pritchard&#39;s book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-of-criterion&#34;&gt;The Problem of Criterion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think about what we know, we usually think about one of two kinds of knowledge: 1. &lt;em&gt;propositional knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, knowledge expressible with a proposition, such as &amp;quot;the sky is blue&amp;quot;, or 2. &lt;em&gt;ability knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, such as the knowledge of how to swim. Henceforth, when talking about knowledge, we will always be referring to the former. It is agreed upon epistemologists that the two basic elements for one to posess a piece of knowledge are truth and belief: one should believe the knowledge and the knowledge itself should be true. However, these two conditions not sufficient. Knowledge is not merely true beliefs: one can have true beliefs completely by accident. Suppose that there is a doctor who diagnoses a patient by a toss of a coin. Suppose also that the coin toss happens to give the correct diagnoses, then does it follow that the doctor knows what is wrong with the patient? Obviously not. Thus, it is a problem for epistemologists to try and figure out what is needed to be added to give a satisfactory definition (i.e. criterion) of knowledge. However, anyone who wishes to define knowledge faces the an immediate problem. To know the criterion of knowledge we need to know all that we do know, but to know all that we do know requires us to know the criterion of knowledge itself. It&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;Catch-22&lt;/em&gt;. This is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_the_criterion&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;problem of the criterion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do we know (what is the extent of our knowledge)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we know (what is the criterion of knowledge)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these two problems are impossible to answer without first answering the other. One approach seeks to answer the first question first -- this is stance called &lt;em&gt;particularism&lt;/em&gt;, advocated by Roderick Chisholm &amp;quot;we start with particular cases of knowledge and then from those we generalise and formulate criteria [which tell] us what it is for a belief to be epistemologically respectable.&amp;quot; The antithesis of this position is &lt;em&gt;methodism&lt;/em&gt;, exemplified by René Descartes, which seeks to answer the second question first. This position states that it is possible, through philosophical reflection alone, to identify criterions of knowledge, and through which to identify instances of knowledge. This is the position taken by classical empiracists. There is also a third stance, skepticism, which proclaims that since it is impossible to answer one question without the other, we are unable to answer either question, and hence unable to justify any of our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gettier-cases&#34;&gt;Gettier Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very natural methodist attempt to the problem of criterion, typically attributed to Plato, is to proclaim that knowledge are &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; true beliefs, i.e. true beliefs with some good basis or grounds. This is the &lt;em&gt;tripartite theory of knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. However, things are not that simple. The philosopher Edmund Gettier, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/23/6/121/109949&#34;&gt;a three-page article&lt;/a&gt;, gave a list of devastating counter-examples to the tripartite theory, which we call the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gettier Cases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showing that it is completely untenable. In essence, it shows that you could have a justified true belief but still lack knowledge because your true belief was gained by luck in the same way as the previous example of the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will here paraphrase an example of such a case from Pritchard&#39;s book. Imagine a man named, say, John, comes downstairs one morning and sees the clock on the living room says it&#39;s 8 o&#39;clock. On this basis, John believes it is 8 o&#39;clock. John usually comes downstairs around this time, and the clock has been very realiable in the past, so John is justified in his belief. Suppose, however, it was unbeknownst to him that the clock had stopped precisely 12 hours ago. So John had a justified true belief which does not intuitively constitute knowledge -- other Gettier cases more or less have the same structure as this example. Therefore, the tripartite account is insufficient for the criterion of knowledge (it is, however, agreed among epistemologists that the tripartite conditions are necessary for having knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at first believed that the Gettier cases could be amended by tweaking the tripartite condition, such as stipulating that the belief should be true, justified, and not based on false presuppositions. However, it is difficult to specify the meaning of &amp;quot;presuppositions&amp;quot;, e.g. you could have a justification of a true belief with a false presupposition. For example, John could have a friend Sally who looks at a working clock and thinks that the time is 8 o&#39;clock, but she might justify this by presupposing the clock is regularly maintained, which happens to not be the case. Moreover, it is also not clear that a presuppoosition is needed at all. For example, suppose a farmer forms a belief that there is a sheep in the field by looking at a shaggy dog which looks like a sheep, but there actually is a sheep on the field, standing behind the dog. Thus, it is difficult to respond to Gettier cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;agrippas-trilemma&#34;&gt;Agrippa&#39;s trilemma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of justification is enigmatic. Pick any belief for which you have a justification, then it still remains the question: what justifies the justification itself? And if we have a justification of that justification, what justifies it then? We could keep asking this question ad infinitum. Thus, we find ourselves in the following predicament called the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma#Agrippa&#39;s_Trilemma&#34;&gt;Agrippa&#39;s trilemma&lt;/a&gt; (or Münchhausen trilemma): in order to justify any statement, we must accept one of the following kind of arguments, each of which is unsatisfactory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;circular argument&lt;/em&gt;: the justification of a proposition presupposes itself,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;regressive argument&lt;/em&gt;: each justification requires a further justification ad infinitum,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;dogmatic argument&lt;/em&gt;: some statements are regarded as accepted precepts (merely asserted but not defended).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some philosophers embrace option 1, and proclaim that a circular chain of arguments can justify a claim, which is a position called &lt;em&gt;coherentism&lt;/em&gt;. This is usually supplemented with the proviso that the circular chain must be large enough. Other philosophers embrace option 2, and proclaim that we can justify a claim by an infinite chain of arguments, which is a position called &lt;em&gt;infinitism&lt;/em&gt;. The third position is to embrace option 3, and proclaim some beliefs are justified without without any further justification, which is a position known as &lt;em&gt;foundationalism&lt;/em&gt; -- the position taken in modern mathematics. The dominant foundationalist view states that some beliefs do not require further justification because there are self-justifying -- this is known as &lt;em&gt;classical foundationalism&lt;/em&gt;. An example of a classical foundationalist is Descartes. He argued that the foundations for our knowledge are those that immune to doubt and are hence self-evident. He gave the example of ones belief of ones own existance. I cannot doubt my own existance because for me to doubt -- to think -- requires my existing in the first place. Hence his famous line, &amp;quot;I think, therefore I am.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-of-perception&#34;&gt;The Problem of Perception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large portion of our knowledge comes from our senses, i.e. perceptual knowledge. We tend to think that our sensory faculties are reliable, but perceptual knowledge can deceive us. This is because fundamentally perceptions are an &lt;em&gt;indirect&lt;/em&gt; way of gaining knowledge -- our perceived reality could be hallucinations undetectable from reality. This is the &lt;em&gt;argument from illusion&lt;/em&gt;. It is odd as it contradicts our intuitive sense that we are directly experiencing reality, hence we have a problem: could we ever directly directly perceive the physical world? This is the &lt;em&gt;problem of perception&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One response to this problem is &lt;em&gt;indirect realism&lt;/em&gt;, which embraces the apparent indirectness of our perception, and proclaims that we gain knowledge of the objective world by making inferences from our sense impressions. John Locke makes the distinction between primary and secondary qualities of an object perceived: a primary quality of an object is a quality independent of anyone perceiving the object e.g. shape, and a secondary quality is a quality dependent upon the perception of an object, e.g. color. Indirect realists use this notion to distinguish world-as-it-is and world-as-perceived. This view, however, threatens to dislocate ourselves from the world. Skeptics respond by the famous thought experiment of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;brain in a vat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: how do we know whether our perceived reality is simulated with a supercomputer? This is the &lt;em&gt;problem of the external world&lt;/em&gt;. How could I, in this case, infer anything at all about the objective world? Thus, there is no reason to assume so in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view that denies there is a world independent of our experience is &lt;em&gt;idealism&lt;/em&gt;, a famous exponent of which is George Berkeley. This position claims that perceptual knowledge is not knowledge of a world independent of perception, but knowledge of a world constituted by our perception of it. In this view, the world is constructed out of perception -- &amp;quot;to be is to be perceived.&amp;quot; However, idealist typically don&#39;t agree that the world cease to exist when no one is to perceive it. To avoid such dramatic consequence, Berkeley proclaims that there is a God who perceives everything, which does not convince me very much. Another version of idealism is &lt;em&gt;transcendental idealism&lt;/em&gt; by Immanuel Kant. Kant argues that although what we perceive may not be the world itself, we are required to suppose that there is an external world which gives rise to such experience, without which we cannot make sense of it. This sounds like indirect realism, but it is idealism in the sense that Kant rejects the possibility of gaining knowledge independent of experience through experience at all, directly or not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-priori-a-posteriori-and-problem-of-induction&#34;&gt;A Priori, A Posteriori, and Problem of Induction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We distinguish between a priori knowledge, knowledge gained independent of empircal investigation, and a posteriori knowledge i.e. empircal knowledge. For example, an important variety of a priori knowledge is introspection -- the examination of one&#39;s own psychology. All proposition that one could have a priori knowledge of, one could also have a posteriori knowledge of. From these knowledge, we could infer more with argument. The general types of arguments are: deduction, induction, abduction, analogy and fallacy. Inductive arguments infer from a large number of a posteriori knowledge, the sample, a general claim that goes beyond the sample. David Hume raised the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;problem of induction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which questions whether inductive arguments are justified. There seem that the only way to justify inductive arguments is by further use of the argument -- by observing the correlation between observed regularity in a large sample and unrestricted regularity. The justification of the inductive inference is circular. Some respond to the problem by claiming it is a fundamental epistemic practice, and some claim that it does not matter as long as inductive arguments work, but those defenses are hardly intellectually satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Popper&#39;s response to this problem is &lt;em&gt;critical rationalism&lt;/em&gt;: inductive inference are never used in science, instead they conjecture hypotheses, deductively infer consequences from them, and empiracally try to falsify the consequences. Therefore, scientists in fact use deductive inferences rather than inductive inferences. There are some problems with this position. One problem is in this view, we do not actually know the generalizations that scientists make, but only the falsity of the falsified theories. This would mean we don&#39;t know that the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; scientific theories are true, only that they have not been falsified yet. Another problem is that it is not clear how much counter evidence is needed to falsify a claim. If it is been observed for many years that emus are flightless, then a testimony that one has seen a flying emus does not necessarily constitude enough evidence to falsify that claim. An alternative approach is given by Hans Reichenbach&#39;s &lt;em&gt;pragmatism&lt;/em&gt;. Reichenbach agrees that there is no justification for inductive reference, but it is pragmatic to use it since it gives us a lot of true beliefs of the world, thus it is nevertheless a rational thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-of-other-minds&#34;&gt;Problem of Other Minds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take for granted that other people have minds like we do, but this is not entirely obvious. We cannot observe other minds like we observe objects, and we cannot experience other&#39;s perspective like we experience our own either. Thus, there is skepticism to whether other people also have the first person experience like &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do. This is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_other_minds&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;problem of other minds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most famous response is from John Stuart Mill, who make use of inductive reasoning. I observe that the behaviors of others mirror our own, from this I inductively infer that they have minds like I do. This is the &lt;em&gt;argument from analogy&lt;/em&gt;. There are problems with this argument as well. In the 1956 film &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049366/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invasion of the Body-Snatchers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, aliens quitely replace real people but they act and behave just like regular people, but they do not experience the world as we do. This points out the flaw in the argument from analogy: we cannot be sure just by observing behavior. In this argument, we could infer that things, such as a highly advanced robot, has a mind, when it is not clear if it is true. A series of videos on this topic (in Chinese) can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1D94y1m7Ft/?share_source=copy_web&amp;amp;vd_source=54d0c49d785d283eeaaec59f84aebba4&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;radical-skeptical-paradox&#34;&gt;Radical Skeptical Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A skeptical hypothesis is a scenario whereby one is severely deceived about the world but unable to detect such deception. In epistemology, skeptical hypotheses are used as a litmus test for any theory of knowledge. Thus skepticism is seen as a methodological devil&#39;s advocate. This gives rise to the &lt;em&gt;radical skeptical paradox&lt;/em&gt;: since we are unable to know the denials of skeptical hypotheses, we are unable to know anything of substance at all about the world. There is a lot more about this topic, but I&#39;m tired and I think I will stop here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wenkai-paragraph&#34;&gt;Wenkai paragraph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;wenkai&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;　　&lt;em&gt;列位看官&lt;/em&gt;，&lt;strong&gt;你道此书&lt;/strong&gt;从何而来？说起根由&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;虽近荒唐&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;，细谙则深有趣味。待在下将此来历注明，方使闻者了然不惑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;　　原来，当年女娲氏炼石补天之时，于大荒山无稽崖炼成高经十二丈，方经二十四丈顽石三万六千五百零一块。娲皇氏只用了三万六千五百块，只单单剩了一块未用，便弃在此山青埂峰下。谁知此石自经煅炼之后，灵性已通，因见众石俱得补天，独自己无材不堪入选，遂自怨自嗟，日夜悲号惭愧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;　　一日，正当嗟悼之馀，俄见一僧一道远远而来，生得骨骼不凡，丰神迥异，说说笑笑来至峰下，坐于石边高谈快论。先是说些云山雾海神仙玄幻之事，后便说到红尘中荣华富贵。此石听了，不觉打动凡心，也想要到人间去享一享这荣华富贵，但自恨粗蠢，不得已，便口吐人言，向那僧道说道：“大师，弟子蠢物，不能见礼了。适闻二位谈那人世间荣耀繁华，心切慕之。弟子质虽粗蠢，性却稍通，况见二师仙形道体，定非凡品，必有补天济世之材，利物济人之德。如蒙发一点慈心，携带弟子得入红尘，在那富贵场中，温柔乡里受享几年，自当永佩洪恩，万劫不忘也。”二仙师听毕，齐憨笑道：“善哉，善哉！那红尘中有却有些乐事，但不能永远依恃。况又有美中不足、好事多魔八个字紧相连属，瞬息间则又乐极悲生，人非物换，究竟是到头一梦，万境归空，倒不如不去的好。”这石凡心已炽，那里听得进这话去，乃复苦求再四。二仙知不可强制，乃叹道：“此亦静极思动，无中生有之数也。既如此，我们便携你去受享受享，只是到不得意时，切莫后悔。”石道：“自然，自然。”那僧又道：“若说你性灵，却又如此质蠢，并更无奇贵之处。如此也只好踮脚而已。也罢，我如今大施佛法助你助，待劫终之日，复还本质，以了此案。你道好否？”石头听了，感谢不尽。那僧便念咒书符，大展幻术，将一块大石登时变成一块鲜明莹洁的美玉，且又缩成扇坠大小的可佩可拿。那僧托于掌上，笑道：“形体倒也是个宝物了！还只没有实在的好处，须得再镌上数字，使人一见便知是奇物方妙。然后携你到那昌明隆盛之邦，诗礼簪缨之族，花锦繁华之地，温柔富贵之乡去安身乐业。”石头听了，喜不能禁，乃问：“不知弟子那几件奇处，又不知携了弟子到何处？望乞明示，使弟子不惑。”那僧笑道：“你且莫问，日后自然明白的。”说着，便袖了那石，同那道人飘然而去，竟不知投奔何方何舍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;palatino-paragraph&#34;&gt;Palatino Paragraph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;palatino&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;　　&lt;em&gt;Call me Ishmael&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Some years&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ago—never&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;　　There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;　　Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
