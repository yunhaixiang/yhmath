  <meta name="description" content="Interests
My primary interests in mathematics lie in number theory and in particular arithmetic geometry, which studies arithmetic by applying insights from geometry and topology.
More specifically, some topics that I especially want to understand are

Cohomology theories in arithmetic geometry
Rational points on varieties and algebraic stacks
Enumerative geometry over arbitrary ground fields
Galois representations, étale sheaves, and ramification theory

Outside my primary interests, I would also love to learn more about mathematical logic and representation theory. At heart, I am an algebraist, and I have general interests in all kinds of mathematics of an algebraic or “conceptual” flavor. I&#39;m also interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and their interactions with mathematics.">
