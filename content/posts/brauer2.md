The mathematics are usually considered as being the very antipodes of Poesy. Yet Mathesis and Poesy are of the closest kindred, for they are both works of the imagination.

Continuing from [Part I](/posts/brauer1), we delve deeper into Brauer groups. In this post, we'll compute examples of Brauer groups of fields, relate them to cohomology, discuss period-index, and prove several relevant theorems including Skolem-Noether theorem and Wedderburn's theorem. We will also generalize the Brauer group construction to schemes. These will correspond generally to {{< cite key="Poo17" >}} from chapters 2 and 3.
