Mathematics is not the rigid and rigidity-producing schema that the layman thinks it is; rather, in it we find ourselves at that meeting point of constraint and freedom that is the very essence of human nature.

Expander graphs are sparse graphs with strong connectivity properties. They show up across combinatorics, theoretical computer science, and number theory, and they serve as a bridge between random-like behavior and explicit constructions. This post will collect definitions, basic examples, and a few standard criteria (spectral gap and etc). My main motivations will come from number theory, so there will be inclinations towards that. I will basically be following Kowalski's excellent notes on expander graphs {{< cite key="Kow24" >}}, with supplements from Godsil's textbook {{< cite key="God93" >}}.
