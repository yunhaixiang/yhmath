## Interests

My main interests in mathematics lie in number theory and arithmetic geometry, which studies arithmetic by applying insights from geometry and topology. 
More specifically, some topics that I especially want to understand are 

1. Cohomology theories in arithmetic geometry
2. Rational points on varieties and algebraic stacks
3. Enumerative geometry over arbitrary ground fields
4. Galois representations, étale sheaves, and ramification theory

Outside my main interests, I would also like to learn more about mathematical logic and the applications of artifical intelligence to mathematical research. Additionally, I have some interests in computer graphics as well.

## Publications

Coming soon.

## Notes

I write and continue to update self-contained notes on various mathematical topics. Here are some that I have written.

1. _Linear Algebraic Groups and Representation Theory_ (coming soon)
2. _Algebraic Curves and Abelian Varieties_ (coming soon)
3. _Algebraic Number Theory_ (coming soon)
