## Interests

My main interests in mathematics lie in [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory) and particularly [arithmetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_geometry), which studies arithmetic by applying insights coming from geometry and topology. 
More specifically, the topics that I especially want to understand are 

1. Rational points on varieties and algebraic stacks
1. Enumerative geometry over arbitrary ground fields
1. Monodromy representations, étale sheaves, and ramification theory

Outside of my main interests, I’m also interested in combinatorics, representation theory, mathematical logic, and the applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning to mathematical research (AI for Math). 

## Publications

Coming soon.

## Notes

I write and continuously update self-contained notes on various mathematical topics. 

1. [_Linear Algebraic Groups and Representation Theory_](https://yunhaixiang.github.io/linalggrps/linalggrps.pdf)   [[source]](https://github.com/yunhaixiang/linalggrps)
2. _Algebraic Curves and Abelian Varieties_ (coming soon)
3. _Algebraic Number Theory_ (coming soon)
