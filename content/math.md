## Interests

My primary interests in mathematics lie in number theory in particular arithmetic geometry, which studies arithmetic by applying insights from geometry and topology. 
More specifically, some topics that I especially want to understand are 

1. Cohomology theories in arithmetic geometry
1. Rational points on varieties and algebraic stacks
1. Enumerative geometry over arbitrary ground fields
1. Monodromy representations, étale sheaves, and ramification theory


Outside of my main interests, I’m also interested in combinatorics, representation theory, mathematical logic, and the applications of artifical intelligence and machine learning to mathematics. 

## Publications

Coming soon.

## Notes

I write and continuously update self-contained notes on various mathematical topics. 

1. [_Linear Algebraic Groups and Representation Theory_](https://yunhaixiang.github.io/linalggrps/linalggrps.pdf)   [[source]](https://github.com/yunhaixiang/linalggrps)
2. _Algebraic Curves and Abelian Varieties_ (coming soon)
3. _Algebraic Number Theory_ (coming soon)
