## Interests

My main interests in mathematics lie in number theory and arithmetic geometry, which studies arithmetic by applying insights from geometry and topology. 
More specifically, some topics that I especially want to understand are 

1. Cohomology theories in arithmetic geometry
2. Rational points on varieties and algebraic stacks
3. Enumerative geometry over arbitrary ground fields
4. Galois representations, étale sheaves, and ramification theory

Outside my main interests, I would also love to learn more about representation theory, combinatorics, and mathematical logic. At heart, I am an algebraist, and I have general interests in all kinds of mathematics of an algebraic flavor. I am also interested in applied mathematics, in particular, math related to artificial intelligence.

## Publications

Coming soon.

## Notes

I write and continue to update self-contained notes on various mathematical topics. Here are some that I have written.

1. _Linear Algebraic Groups and Representation Theory_ (coming soon)
2. _Algebraic Curves and Abelian Varieties_ (coming soon)
3. _Algebraic Number Theory_ (coming soon)
