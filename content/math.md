## Interests

My primary interests in mathematics lie in number theory and in particular arithmetic geometry, which studies arithmetic by applying insights from geometry and topology. 
More specifically, some topics that I especially want to understand are 

1. Cohomology theories in arithmetic geometry
2. Rational points on varieties and algebraic stacks
3. Enumerative geometry over arbitrary ground fields
4. Galois representations, étale sheaves, and ramification theory

Outside my primary interests, I would also love to learn more about mathematical logic and representation theory. At heart, I am an algebraist, and I have general interests in all kinds of mathematics of an algebraic or “conceptual” flavor. I'm also interested in artificial interlligence, machine learning, and their interactions with pure mathematics. 

## Publications

Coming soon.

## Notes

I write and continue to update self-contained notes on various mathematical topics. Here are some that I have written.

1. _Linear Algebraic Groups and Representation Theory_ (coming soon)
2. _Algebraic Curves and Abelian Varieties_ (coming soon)
3. _Algebraic Number Theory_ (coming soon)

Here are some on very specific topics which are on the shorter side. 

1. _Brauer Groups_ (coming soon)
