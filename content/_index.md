My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”). I'm from the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang, China. I'm a Ph.D. student in mathematics at Western University under Prof. Chris Hall. Previously, I obtained my M.Sc. in Mathematics at Western University and B.Math. in Pure Mathematics (with Distinction) at University of Waterloo. In my free time, I enjoy [films](posts/films), [anime](posts/anime), [video games](posts/video-games), [music](posts/music), and [reading](posts/books-and-essays). I occasionally do [magic tricks](posts/magic-tricks), which is a hobbie of mine since I was young. In my blog, I write about math, philosophy, puzzles, my life, things I'm learning, and sometimes I write short fiction stories. I can be reached by [email](mailto:yxiang72@uwo.ca). Here is my [curriculum vitae](doc/CV.pdf) and my [GitHub](https://github.com/yunhaixiang) page. Moreover, here are some [links](posts/links) that you might find useful.
