Hello! My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), and I also go by Daniel. I came from Wenzhou city in Zhejiang, China. 
I'm a Ph.D. student in pure mathematics at University of Western Ontario. My advisor is Prof. Chris Hall. Previously, I obtained my M.Sc. in Mathematics at University of Western Ontario and B.Math. in Pure Mathematics (with Distinction) at University of Waterloo. 
In my free time, I enjoy films, anime, video games, reading, writing, and magic tricks.
