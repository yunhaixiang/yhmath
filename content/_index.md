Hello! My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), and I also go by Daniel. 
I'm a Ph.D. student in pure mathematics at University of Western Ontario. My advisor is Prof. Chris Hall. 
I can be reached by [email](mailto:yxiang72@uwo.ca). Here is my [curriculum vitae](assets/CV.pdf). Here is my GitHub page. 
In my free time, I enjoy films, anime, video games, reading, writing, and magic tricks.
