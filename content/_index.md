Hello! My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), and I also go by Daniel. I'm from the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang, China. 
I'm a Ph.D. student in pure mathematics at University of Western Ontario under Prof. Chris Hall. Previously, I obtained my M.Sc. in Mathematics at University of Western Ontario and B.Math. in Pure Mathematics (with Distinction) at University of Waterloo. 
In my free time, I enjoy films, anime, music, video games, reading, writing, and magic tricks (click on these links to see more). 
I can be reached by [email](mailto:yxiang72@uwo.ca). Here is my [curriculum vitae](assets/CV.pdf), and here is my [GitHub](https://github.com/yunhaixiang) page, where you can find my coding projects. 
Moreover, here are some [links](posts/links) that you might find useful.
