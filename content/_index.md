My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), and I also go by Daniel. I'm from Wenzhou in Zhejiang, China. I'm a Ph.D. student in mathematics at Western University advised by Prof. Chris Hall. In my free time, I enjoy [reading](posts/books-and-essays), [films](posts/films), [anime](posts/anime), [music](posts/music), [video games](posts/video-games), and performing [magic tricks](posts/magic-tricks). I am also trying to learn game development. In my blog, I write about math, philosophy, puzzles, my life, things I'm learning, and sometimes I write short fiction stories. I can be reached by [email](mailto:yxiang72@uwo.ca). Here is my [curriculum vitae](doc/CV.pdf) and my [GitHub](https://github.com/yunhaixiang) page. Moreover, here are some [links](posts/links) that you might find useful.
